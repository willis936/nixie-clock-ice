The Infineon SIMetrix SPICE files are made publicly available with this disclaiimer:

Models provided by Infineon are not warranted by Infineon as
fully representing all the specifications and operating
characteristics of the semiconductor product to which the
model relates. The models describe the characteristics of
typical devices.
In all cases, the current data sheet information for a given
device is the final design guideline and the only actual
performance specification.
Although models can be a useful tool in evaluating device
performance, they cannot model exact device performance under
all conditions, nor are they intended to replace bread-
boarding for final verification. INFINEON therefore does not
assume any liability arising from their use.
INFINEON reserves the right to change models without prior
notice.


The metacollin LTspiceInfineonNMOSLibrary github repo that converts these to LTSpice
claims to be based off of a repo that is licensed under MIT, but the link is dead
and this repo does not have an explicit license file.
Presumably these were redacted because Infineon does not license their SPICE models.
