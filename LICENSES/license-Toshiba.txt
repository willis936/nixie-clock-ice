Agreement on Simulation Model

This Agreement is made between Toshiba Electronic Devices and Storage Corporation, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "TOSHIBA") and customers that download this Simulation Model through this WEBSITE ("Customer"). Customer shall comply with this Agreement.

1. Definition

    "WEBSITE" means Toshiba Semiconductor & Storage Products website (https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/) TOSHIBA owns and operates.
    "Product" means semiconductor products of TOSHIBA.
    "This DATA" means Simulation Model for the Products listed in the WEBSITE.

2. Restrictions on Usage

    This DATA is provided solely for the purpose of performing the functional evaluation of the Product. Customer shall not use this DATA for any other purpose, including without limitation, verification of reliability.
    Customer shall not incorporate this DATA into your products or system. This DATA is for Customer's own use and not for sale, lease or other transfer.
    Customer shall not disassemble, analyze, reverse-engineer, alter, modify, translate or copy this DATA, whether in whole or in part.
    Customer shall not use this DATA for evaluation in high or low temperature, high humidity, or high electromagnetic environments.
    This DATA shall not be used for or incorporated into any products or systems whose manufacture, use, or sale is prohibited under any applicable laws or regulations.

    This DATA is provided solely for performing the functional evaluation of the Product intended for use in general electronics applications (e.g., computers, personal equipment, office equipment, measuring equipment, industrial robots and home electronics appliances) or for specific applications as stated in this document. This DATA is neither intended nor warranted to be used for functional evaluation of a semiconductor product intended for use in equipment or system that requires extraordinarily high levels of quality and/or reliability and/or a malfunction or failure of which may cause loss of human life, bodily injury, serious property damage or serious public impact ("Unintended Use"). Unintended Use includes, without limitation, equipment used in nuclear facilities, equipment used in the aerospace industry, lifesaving and/or life supporting medical equipment, equipment used for automobiles, trains, ships and other transportation, traffic signaling equipment, equipment used to control combustions or explosions, safety devices, elevators and escalators, and devices related to power plant. Do not use this DATA for functional evaluation of a semiconductor product intended for Unintended Use. When this DATA is for functional evaluation of a semiconductor product intended for specific applications as stated in the Product's document, use this DATA for functional evaluation of the semiconductor product only for those specific applications and not for any other use.
    This DATA is provided solely for the purpose of performing the functional evaluation of the Product. No responsibility is assumed by TOSHIBA for any infringement of patents or any other intellectual property rights of third parties that may result from the use of this DATA.
