[D] Finish decoupling caps on daughter board
[D] Finish decoupling caps on main board
[ ] Use a common emitter to bleed HV capacitor only when 3.3V is not present (simulate behavior), bleed with 10M always
[ ] Check that analog traces are clear of DIO traces
[ ] Check TX/RX polarity
[ ] Check FPGA GPIO banking rules
[ ] Flip pico iCE over for better access to user I/O
[ ] Make sure SW2 is used for timezone offset control
[D] Remove pulldown resistors from DIP switches
[ ] Make sure DIP switches connect to ground for pull-up compatability
[ ] Add test points for ground, power supply rails, HV gate, and pre-digitized signals
[ ] Simulate HV circuit
[ ] Try to reduce inductor and capacitor size to fit under daughter boards
[ ] Switch to axial cap for HV for low profile
[D] Try to have IC GND pads make a minimal loop size with the decoupling cap GND pad
[D] Change decoupling cap vias to 0.3 mm for reduced inductance and try to put the GND and +5V vias close together
