[D] Finish decoupling caps on daughter board
[D] Finish decoupling caps on main board
[ ] Use a common emitter to bleed HV capacitor only when 3.3V is not present (simulate behavior), bleed with 10M always
[ ] Check that analog traces are clear of DIO traces
[ ] Check TX/RX polarity
[ ] Check FPGA GPIO banking rules
[ ] Flip pico iCE over for better access to user I/O
[D] Make sure SW2 is used for timezone offset control
[D] Remove pulldown resistors from DIP switches
[D] Make sure DIP switches connect to ground for pull-up compatability
[ ] Add test points for ground, power supply rails, HV gate, and pre-digitized signals
[ ] Add shunt jumpers for current measurements on power supply rails
[ ] Simulate HV circuit
[ ] Try to reduce inductor and capacitor size to fit under daughter boards
[ ] Switch to axial cap for HV for low profile
[D] Try to have IC GND pads make a minimal loop size with the decoupling cap GND pad
[D] Change decoupling cap vias to 0.3 mm for reduced inductance and try to put the GND and +5V vias close together
[ ] Move ADC up near U8 to have trace lengths closer matches
[ ] Use a fixed LM5155 to boost 5V to 15V then another LM5155 with a voltage controller resistor (FET if necessary, MPSA42 if possible, sim it)
[D] ML2032 charging circuit (LTC4054) + 3.3V regulator (shelved, KISS)
[ ] Second set of tubes on another board to the side for precision time (use a sense GPIO to increase the HV data width and OE rate)
[ ] Add fiducials
