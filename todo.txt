[ ] switch to single stage flyback topology
[ ] simulate HV supply
[D] swap all TH for SM options
[D] swap daughter board footprints for proper pin socket BOM items
[ ] refresh BOM
[D] switch to static level shifter, tie CS and RD low, direct connect WR, ignore INT

[ ] Second set of tubes on another board to the side for precision time (use a sense GPIO to increase the HV data width and OE rate)
[ ] IN-12 daughter board
