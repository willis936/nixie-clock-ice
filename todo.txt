[D] Finish decoupling caps on daughter board
[D] Finish decoupling caps on main board
[D] Use a common emitter to bleed HV capacitor only when 3.3V is not present (simulate behavior), bleed with 10M always
[D] Check that analog traces are clear of DIO traces
[D] Check TX/RX polarity
[D] Check FPGA GPIO banking rules
[D] Flip pico iCE over for better access to user I/O
[D] Make sure SW2 is used for timezone offset control
[D] Remove pulldown resistors from DIP switches
[D] Make sure DIP switches connect to ground for pull-up compatability
[D] Add test points for ground, power supply rails, HV gate, and pre-digitized signals
[D] Add shunt jumpers for current measurements on power supply rails
[D] Simulate HV circuit
[D] Try to reduce inductor and capacitor size to fit under daughter boards
[D] Switch to axial cap for HV for low profile (yeah right, these are massive)
[D] Try to have IC GND pads make a minimal loop size with the decoupling cap GND pad
[D] Change decoupling cap vias to 0.3 mm for reduced inductance and try to put the GND and +5V vias close together
[D] Move ADC up near U8 to have trace lengths closer matches
[D] Use a fixed LM5155 to boost 5V to 15V then another LM5155 with a voltage controller resistor (FET if necessary, MPSA42 if possible, sim it)
[D] ML2032 charging circuit (LTC4054) + 3.3V regulator (shelved, KISS)
[ ] Second set of tubes on another board to the side for precision time (use a sense GPIO to increase the HV data width and OE rate)
[D] Add fiducials
[D] Check if bias-T is needed for GPS active antenna
