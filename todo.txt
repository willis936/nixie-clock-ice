[ ] switch to single stage flyback topology
[ ] simulate HV supply
[ ] swap all TH for SM options
[ ] swap daughter board footprints for proper pin socket BOM items

[ ] Second set of tubes on another board to the side for precision time (use a sense GPIO to increase the HV data width and OE rate)
[ ] IN-12 daughter board
